# Percentage change formula
- id: percentage-change
  title: Percentage Change
  categories: [basic math]
  tags: [price, cost, change]
  equation: |
    $$
    \text{Percentage Change} = \frac{\text{New Value} - \text{Old Value}}{\text{Old Value}} \times 100\%
    $$
  comment: "Percentage change measures the relative difference between a new value and an old value. Positive result → increase, negative result → decrease."

# Sales price given cost and margin
- id: sales-price-given-cost-and-margin
  title: Sales Price given Cost and Margin
  categories: [margin, pricing]
  tags: [profit, cost, margin]
  equation: |
    $$
    \text{Price} = \frac{\text{Cost}}{1 - \text{Margin}}
    $$
  comment: "Margin is expressed as a decimal (e.g., 30% → 0.30). This formula grosses up cost to the selling price, ensuring the margin is preserved."
  examples:
    - example-comment: "Cost = $70, Margin = 0.30 → Price = $100"
      example-equation: |
        $$
        \text{Price} = \frac{70}{1 - 0.30} = \frac{70}{0.70} = 100
        $$

# Item cost given price and margin
- id: cost-given-price-and-margin
  title: Cost given Price and Margin
  categories: [margin, pricing]
  tags: [profit, cost, margin]
  equation: |
    $$
    \text{Cost} = \text{Price} \times (1 - \text{Margin})
    $$
  comment: "Rearranging the price formula allows cost to be derived from price and margin.  "
  examples:
    - example-comment: "Price = $100, Margin = 0.30  → Cost = $70"
      example-equation: |
        $$
        \text{Cost} = 100 \times (1 - 0.30) = 100 \times 0.70 = 70
        $$  
    - example-comment: "Price = $120, Margin = 0.30  → Cost = $84"
      example-equation: |
        $$
        \text{Cost} = 120 \times (1 - 0.30) = 100 \times 0.70 = 84
        $$

# Margin given selling price and cost

  title: Distributor margin given Customer price and Distributor Price
  categories: [margin, pricing]
  tags: [profit, cost, margin]
  equation: |
    $$
    \text{Distributor Margin} =
    \frac{\text{Customer Price} - \text{Distributor Price}}{\text{Customer Price}}
    $$
  comment: "When both distributor and customer discounts apply, the distributor's margin is determined by the gap between the two net prices:  Distributor Price = List Price × (1 − Distributor Discount)  Customer Price = List Price × (1 − Customer Discount)  "
  examples:
    - example-comment: |
        - List Price = $100  
        - Distributor Discount = 40% → Distributor Price = $60  
        - Customer Discount = 20% → Customer Price = $80 
      example-equation: |
        $$
        \text{Distributor Margin} = \frac{80 - 60}{80} = 0.25 \; (25\%)
        $$

# Insert Usage per part

  title: Insert Usage per Part
  categories: [shop math, tooling, cost savings]
  tags: [insert, usage, tool, manufacturing]
  variables: 
    - "$I_p$ inserts used per part (expected, real-valued)"
    - "$z$ number of teeth (inserts mounted in cutter body)"
    - "$z_i$ number of usable edges per insert"
    - "$T$ tool life (parts per insert change)"
  equation: 
    $$
    I_p \;=\; \frac{\dfrac{z}{z_i}}{T} \;=\; \frac{z}{z_i\,T}
    $$
  comment: Dividing inserts by inserts by time (NEED TO REVIEW)
  examples:
    - example-comment: |
        - $I_p$ = inserts used per part (expected, real-valued)  
        - $z$ = number of teeth (inserts mounted in cutter body)  
        - $z_i$ = number of usable edges per insert  
        - $T$ = tool life (parts per insert change)                      
        This formula calculates the expected number of inserts used per part based on tool geometry and life.  
      example-equation: |
        Variables
        $$
        \text{Inserts\_needed}(N) = \left\lceil \frac{z}{z_i} \cdot \frac{N}{T} \right\rceil
        $$

        \begin{aligned}
        z &= 6,\quad z_i = 2,\quad T = 100 \\
        I_p &= \frac{6}{2\cdot 100} = 0.03\ \text{inserts/part} \\
        \text{Inserts\_consumed}(1000) &= 0.03 \times 1000 = 30 \\
        \text{Inserts\_needed}(1000) &= \left\lceil 30 \right\rceil = 30

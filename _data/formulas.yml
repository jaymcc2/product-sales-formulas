- title: Percentage Change
  equation: |
    $$
    \text{Percentage Change} = \frac{\text{New Value} - \text{Old Value}}{\text{Old Value}} \times 100\%
    $$
  explanation: "Percentage change measures the relative difference between a new value and an old value. Positive result → increase, negative result → decrease."

- title: Percentage Increase
  equation: |
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    \text{Percentage Increase} &= \frac{\text{Increase Amount}}{\text{Original Value}} \times 100\% \\
    \text{Increase Amount} &= \text{New Value} - \text{Original Value}
    \end{aligned}
    $$
  explanation: "Percentage increase is a special case of percentage change when the value grows. It compares the increase amount to the original value."

- title: Sales Price given Cost and Margin
  equation: |
    $$
    \text{Price} = \frac{\text{Cost}}{1 - \text{Margin}}
    $$
  explanation: "Margin is expressed as a decimal (e.g., 30% → 0.30). This formula grosses up cost to the selling price, ensuring the margin is preserved."
  example: "Cost = $70, Margin = 0.30 → Price = $100"
  example-equation: |
    $$
    \text{Price} = \frac{70}{1 - 0.30} = \frac{70}{0.70} = 100
    $$
- title: Cost given Price and Margin
  equation: |
    $$
    \text{Cost} = \text{Price} \times (1 - \text{Margin})
    $$
  explanation: "Rearranging the price formula allows cost to be derived from price and margin.  "
  example: "Price = $100, Margin = 0.30  → Cost = $70"
  example-equation: |
    $$
    \text{Cost} = 100 \times (1 - 0.30) = 100 \times 0.70 = 70
    $$

- title: Percentage Change
  equation: |
    $$
    \text{Percentage Change} = \frac{\text{New Value} - \text{Old Value}}{\text{Old Value}} \times 100\%
    $$
  explanation: "Percentage change measures the relative difference between a new value and an old value. Positive result → increase, negative result → decrease."

- title: Percentage Increase
  equation: |
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    \text{Percentage Increase} &= \frac{\text{Increase Amount}}{\text{Original Value}} \times 100\% \\
    \text{Increase Amount} &= \text{New Value} - \text{Original Value}
    \end{aligned}
    $$
  explanation: "Percentage increase is a special case of percentage change when the value grows. It compares the increase amount to the original value."

- title: Sales Price given Cost and Margin
  equation: |
    $$
    \text{Price} = \frac{\text{Cost}}{1 - \text{Margin}}
    $$
  explanation: "Margin is expressed as a decimal (e.g., 30% → 0.30). This formula grosses up cost to the selling price, ensuring the margin is preserved."
  example: "Cost = $70, Margin = 0.30 → Price = $100"
  example-equation: |
    $$
    \text{Price} = \frac{70}{1 - 0.30} = \frac{70}{0.70} = 100
    $$
- title: Cost given Price and Margin
  equation: |
    $$
    \text{Cost} = \text{Price} \times (1 - \text{Margin})
    $$
  explanation: "Rearranging the price formula allows cost to be derived from price and margin.  "
  example: "Price = $100, Margin = 0.30  → Cost = $70"
  example-equation: |
    $$
    \text{Cost} = 100 \times (1 - 0.30) = 100 \times 0.70 = 70
    $$
- title: Margin given Cost and Price
  equation: |
    $$
    \text{Margin} = 1 - \frac{\text{Cost}}{\text{Price}}
    $$
  explanation: "This formula derives margin from cost and price by comparing the profit (price - cost) to the price."
  example: "Price = $100, Cost = $70  → Margin = 0.30"
  example-equation: |
    $$
    \text{Margin} = 1 - \frac{70}{100} = 1 - 0.70 = 0.30
    $$
- title: Discount given Cost and Price
  equation: |
    $$
    \text{Discount} = 1 - \frac{\text{Price}}{\text{List Price}}
    $$
  explanation: "Discount is the percentage reduction from list price.  (If you only have cost & net price, discount can be derived from the assumed list price.) "
  example: "List Price = $120, Price = $100  → Discount = 0.1667 (16.67%)"
  example-equation: |
    $$
    \text{Discount} = 1 - \frac{100}{120} = 1 - 0.8333 = 0.1667
    $$

- title: Margin with Distributor vs. Customer Discount
  equation: |
    $$
    \text{Distributor Margin} =
    \frac{\text{Customer Price} - \text{Distributor Price}}{\text{Customer Price}}
    $$
  explanation: "When both distributor and customer discounts apply, the distributor's margin is determined by the gap between the two net prices:  Distributor Price = List Price × (1 − Distributor Discount)  Customer Price = List Price × (1 − Customer Discount)  "
  example: |
    - List Price = $100  
    - Distributor Discount = 40% → Distributor Price = $60  
    - Customer Discount = 20% → Customer Price = $80 
  example-equation: |
    $$
    \text{Distributor Margin} = \frac{80 - 60}{80} = 0.25 \; (25\%)
    $$

- title: Insert Usage per Part
  equation: |
    $$
    \text{Inserts\_needed}(N) = \left\lceil \frac{z}{z_i} \cdot \frac{N}{T} \right\rceil
    $$
  explanation: |
    "This formula calculates the expected number of inserts used per part based on tool geometry and life.  Variables:
    - $I_p$ = inserts used per part (expected, real-valued)  
    - $z$ = number of teeth (inserts mounted in cutter body)  
    - $z_i$ = number of usable edges per insert  
    - $T$ = tool life (parts per insert change)
  example: |
    - List Price = $100  
    - Distributor Discount = 40% → Distributor Price = $60  
    - Customer Discount = 20% → Customer Price = $80 
  example-equation: |
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    z &= 6,\quad z_i = 2,\quad T = 100 \\
    I_p &= \frac{6}{2\cdot 100} = 0.03\ \text{inserts/part} \\
    \text{Inserts\_consumed}(1000) &= 0.03 \times 1000 = 30 \\
    \text{Inserts\_needed}(1000) &= \left\lceil 30 \right\rceil = 30
    \end{aligned}
    $$
